Class::DBI::Cacheable version 0.01
==================================

package YourApp::DB;
use base 'Class::DBI::Cacheable';
__PACKAGE__->set_db( Main => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=database', 'username', 'password' );

Class::DBI::Cacheable transparently provides cache support to your Class::DBI
framework, with setting, getting and removing of cache entries handled for you.
This can drastically increase performance of applications that use Class::DBI
extensively, since repeated retrievals of the same data from a database is
prevented.

Class::DBI::Cacheable is highly configurable to your application; see the
documentation for more information.
